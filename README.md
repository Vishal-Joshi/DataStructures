# DataStructures
This repository hosts my practice implementations for data structures and algorithms exercises listed @ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/

*Note*- As these are practice implementations, I am just sticking to providing solutions to problems without abiding all clean code practices like KISS, SOLID and optimising code for reusability.
